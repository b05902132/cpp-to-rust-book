# Switch / Match

TODO

[Match](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/match.html) is like a switch statement on steroids.

In C++ a switch is a straight comparison of an integer value of some kind (including chars and enums), against a list of values. If the comparison matches, the code next to it executes until the bottom of the switch statement or a break is reached.
