# Features of Rust compared with C++

Rust and C++ have roughly analogous functionality. The focus of course is different in Rust - to provide safe-by-default programming functionality.

Rust also benefits from starting from a clean slate so it simplifies things that C++ has had no choice but to adapt to over the years such as making itself Unicode compliant.

This section will cover such topics as types, strings, variables, literals, collections, structs, loops and so on. In each case it will draw comparison between how things are in C/C++ and how they are in Rust.

Also bear in mind that Rust compiles to binary code and is *designed* to use C binaries and be used by C binaries. Therefore the generated code is similar, but it is different as source.
